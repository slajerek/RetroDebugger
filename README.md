# Hello and welcome to the Retro Debugger!

This is Commodore 64, Atari XL/XE and NES code and memory debugger 
that works in real time. It is quick prototyping tool where you 
can play with 8-bit machine and its internals.

Note that this is not ready product, this is still beta version.

If you are starting this for the first time and looking for Atari or
Commodore, then you first need to setup your own ROMs of these retro
computers. You can find that in the Settings menu. 

ROMS: 
```
File Size Name
     2048 ATARI5200.rom
     8192 ATARIBASIC.rom
    10240 ATARIOSA.rom
    10240 ATARIOSB.rom
    16384 ATARIXL.rom
     8192 basic
     4096 chargen
    16384 dos1541
    16384 dos1541II
     8192 kernal
```


Retro Debugger embeds Vice v3.1, Atari800 and NestopiaUE 
emulator engines provided by:

Vice: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vice-emu/
Atari800: http://atari800.github.io
NestopiaUE: http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/

Thank you for that awesome part of code!

# Usage

The README usage file for this version is not ready yet.
Please refer to the old C64 65XE NES Debugger documentation in ./docs folder.
https://sourceforge.net/p/c64-debugger/code/ci/master/tree/MTEngine/Assets/README.txt

Note that you can right-click now on some of the views to display context menu.

# How to compile

Code is based on MTEngineSDL.
Engine compiles SDL2 with ImGui and this app as a static binary.
You need to compile the MTEngineSDL first.

MTEngineSDL: https://github.com/slajerek/MTEngineSDL
SDL2: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
ImGui: https://github.com/imgui

## macOS

cd ./platform/MacOS
I normally put files into `~/develop/c64d` folder. 
Project should compile as is in Xcode, remember to reference MTEngineSDL
library.

## Windows

Check VS2019 project in `./platform/Windows`. This should work when put into
`C:\develop\c64d`. Note, the SDL2 library was built static.

## Linux

You need SDL2 and GLEW installed:
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
`sudo apt install libglew-dev`

Put MTEngineSDL and RetroDebugger folders into the same folder and then compile.

```
cd RetroDebugger
./build-linux.sh
```

Remember to have MTEngineSDL library in `./../../MTEngineSDL` folder.
